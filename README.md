  ## Usage

From the landing page, the user will see some basic stats on their most recent workout. They can choose "Continue Workout" to add to the most recent workout, or "New Workout" to begin a new one. 

Either option will bring the user to the "Add Your Exercise" screen. The user can choose a Cardio or a Resistance workout, and will be prompted for some additional details based on that choice.

At any point the user can click on "Dashboard" in the upper left corner. They will be able to view a dashboard of exercises completed in the last week and some data visualizations.
